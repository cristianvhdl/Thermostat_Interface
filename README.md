# Thermostat_Interface
Heating and cooling system account for almost half of the energy consumption in a typical North America household. More and more homes are using a smart thermostat to help them save energy related cost. We are interested in using the thermostat and a mobile application to find a way that will further influence the user to perform energy conserving actions with the help of smart user interface (UI) designs and reward mechanisms. <br />

The project consists of two parts: a client-side application and a backend server. The application connects to a smart thermostat via the internet and the users are able to adjust various thermostat settings through the application. The UIs of the application are designed to provide more information about potential energy related savings and should have an impact on user decisions towards energy conservation. All related user actions will be recorded and stored in our backend server for further analysis. The project enables the researchers to investigate the effectiveness of different factors that contribute to energy saving behaviors. <br />
